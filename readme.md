When to use this Criteria Builder

This project includes a custom Criteria Builder designed for heavy and complex queries  cases where you have multiple joins, unions, nested conditions, dynamic filters, and other query logic that grows beyond the usual ORM comfort zone.

If your project is small or the queries are simple, you don’t need this builder at all.
For basic use cases, the standard Doctrine QueryBuilder is more than enough.

This builder exists for situations where the default ORM tools become limiting and you want a structured and reusable way to build difficult queries.
